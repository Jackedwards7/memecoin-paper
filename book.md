*Paper only: simulated fills from live DexScreener prices, 1.50% fee each side plus a size/liquidity
slippage charge. No wallet, nothing reaches the market. Written by `memepaper.py` (repo memecoin-paper); do not hand-edit.*

**Equity 9.214 SOL** (start 10.0 SOL, -7.9%) · cash 8.171 SOL ·
open 2 · closed 6 (0 won) · SOL $92.91 · marked 2026-11-04 09:29 UTC

**Benchmark (vs just holding SOL): -7.9%.** The book is counted in SOL, so its SOL
return *is* its edge over holding SOL. In dollars: $856 vs $949 at the start
(-9.8%); SOL itself moved -2.1%.
Review on 2026-11-30 or after 30 closed v2 trades (1/30), rules unchanged until then.

## v2 test (from 2026-11-03 01:30 UTC)

Does picking beat a random coin that passed the same gates, after costs? Each pick opens a same-size
control position on a random gate pass (`control.json`, same mechanical exits, no judgement exits).

| Arm | Closed | Won | P&L SOL (incl. open) | Return on SOL deployed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Picks | 1 | 0 | -0.092 | -37.0% |
| Control | 1 | 0 | -0.092 | -37.0% |

Costs in every fill: 1.5% fee each side, size/liquidity slippage, and a $0.50 sandwich charge per swap.
If every swap were sandwiched at the $5 median: picks -0.092 SOL, control -0.092 SOL.

**Gate value** (raw price moves, no costs; the gate earns its keep if passes beat rejects):
passes 0 tracked, median 1d n/a, 3d n/a, 7d n/a · rejects 5 tracked, median 1d -12%, 3d n/a, 7d n/a.
Legacy v1 positions (opened before v2, 1.25% fee model, sizes to 1 SOL) stay under the same exits and are left out of this table.
